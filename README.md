**Structural Prognostic Event Modeling for Multimodal Cancer Survival Analysis**

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of **SlotSPE**, a novel framework for structural prognostic event modeling in multimodal cancer survival analysis.

SlotSPE is a slot-based framework that models sparse, patient-specific structural prognostic events from multimodal cancer data to enable efficient interaction modeling and improve survival prediction.

## 🚧 Code Release Schedule

The full implementation of SlotSPE is currently being finalized.

🗓 **The official training and evaluation code will be released in mid-March 2026.**

We appreciate your patience and interest in our work.
